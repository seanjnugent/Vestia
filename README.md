# Vestia Platform

Vestia started as a sandbox to test some data engineering tools but has grown into something more elaborate. Originally focused on experimenting with Apache Airflow, it now includes a UI and will eventually incorporate Spark and Kafka to explore how they can handle large-scale data processing and real-time streams of price data. Hereâ€™s the current breakdown:

1. **vestia_admin** - A UI for managing accounts, clients, assets and other platform wide operations.
2. **vestia_automation** - Airflow DAGs for scheduled operations and tasks such as caching, updates and performance calculations.
3. **vestia_client** - A client-facing app where investors can track portfolios, make trades and get performance insights.
4. **vestia_server** - A backend server providing APIs for accounts, clients, trades, payments, and more.
